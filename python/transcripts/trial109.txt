Speaker A: And I did my first Nasdaq listing in 1996. And I've been through web one, web two, web three. I've watched crypto the entire time. I love the Metaverse, I love AI, I love nfts, I love blockchain, I love spatial computing. And over the years, I got pulled into real estate because I always loved property, and I've always owned property and I've always fixed it up. But about 14 or 15 years ago, I actually, I don't know if you've heard of a company called IMG. And there was the godfather of sports marketing was a guy called Mark McCormick. And I don't know if you've heard, well, you probably know the Olympics of. So his company, IMG, was the first to televise all the summer and Winter Olympics. They televised all the golf, all the tennis, grand slams, you know, the French, the Italian, the British, the American. He was the godfather of sports marketing. So 16 years ago, I was working with him, and I launched IMG into the Internet world. And then I was tapped by Douglas Elliman in New York, who was the biggest. They were over a century over a century old in New York City. They're the oldest real estate company in New York. They had the largest real estate project in the world, a luxury cruise liner. They wanted to bring in the Internet and help help me, or they needed me to get their billionaires millionaires tickets to the greatest sporting and cultural events in the world. So they invited me to bring IMG over. So that's how I accidentally got involved in real estate 16 or 17 years ago, and I've been in that space ever since. So I love both, actually now. And I am currently have a joint venture partnership with Keller Williams. And I think Keller Williams is maybe the market leader in India now as far as size, as far as real estate agents and brokers in the luxury space in India. And I actually have a joint venture with Keller Williams. And what I did, my New York real estate license didn't transfer when I moved back to Florida in 2020, so I had to take a Florida real estate license. In that time, I met some people in Sarasota, Florida, where I've been living, and I decided because they were the market leader as far as real estate agents and brokers, I would do a deal. I walked in with a luxury cruise liner, my client into them, and they said, hey, we'll offer you the best deal we can do it. And by the way, you know, they know I've got a billion people in my network. So I'm actually got more network and more leads than the biggest real estate companies in the world. So I'm kind of unique because I'm not a real estate guy. I'm a tech guy that just kind of pirate Internet marketing. So I've been on the ride since 1996. So when Angela reached out to me, I love indian people, and I think you guys are the best engineers and programmers and tech people that I know. And I love history because I've watched you guys for a long time, as long as I've been alive, because I've always loved your tennis players, your cricketers, even your squash players. So I love indian food. So I was happy when Angela reached out to me, it's like, wow, you guys, it's great to connect. And when she said, hey, you're doing some cool stuff in AI and real estate, it's like, why not? Good. So I just, I said to Angela, I got half an hour because I got a bunch of other calls, but I had to introduce myself. And then when, you know, Anaker connected to, I said, wow, this is just too cool. And I had to meet you guys and say, hey, I'd love to hear what you're doing, because I appreciate AI. Whereas 99% of real estate agents don't understand what you guys.
