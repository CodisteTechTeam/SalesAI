Speaker A: And I did my first Nasdaq listing in 1996. And I've been through web one, web two, web three. I've watched crypto the entire time. I love the Metaverse, I love AI, I love nfts, I love blockchain, I love spatial computing. And over the years, I got pulled into real estate because I always loved property, and I've always owned property and I've always fixed it up. But about 14 or 15 years ago, I actually, I don't know if you've heard of a company called IMG. And there was the godfather of sports marketing was a guy called Mark McCormick. And I don't know if you've heard, well, you probably know the Olympics of. So his company, IMG, was the first to televise all the summer and Winter Olympics. They televised all the golf, all the tennis, grand slams, you know, the French, the Italian, the British, the American. He was the godfather of sports marketing. So 16 years ago, I was working with him, and I launched IMG into the Internet world. And then I was tapped by Douglas Elliman in New York, who was the biggest. They were over a century over a century old in New York City. They're the oldest real estate company in New York. They had the largest real estate project in the world, a luxury cruise liner. They wanted to bring in the Internet and help help me, or they needed me to get their billionaires millionaires tickets to the greatest sporting and cultural events in the world. So they invited me to bring IMG over. So that's how I accidentally got involved in real estate 16 or 17 years ago, and I've been in that space ever since. So I love both, actually now. And I am currently have a joint venture partnership with Keller Williams. And I think Keller Williams is maybe the market leader in India now as far as size, as far as real estate agents and brokers in the luxury space in India. And I actually have a joint venture with Keller Williams. And what I did, my New York real estate license didn't transfer when I moved back to Florida in 2020, so I had to take a Florida real estate license. In that time, I met some people in Sarasota, Florida, where I've been living, and I decided because they were the market leader as far as real estate agents and brokers, I would do a deal. I walked in with a luxury cruise liner, my client into them, and they said, hey, we'll offer you the best deal we can do it. And by the way, you know, they know I've got a billion people in my network. So I'm actually got more network and more leads than the biggest real estate companies in the world. So I'm kind of unique because I'm not a real estate guy. I'm a tech guy that just kind of pirate Internet marketing. So I've been on the ride since 1996. So when Angela reached out to me, I love indian people, and I think you guys are the best engineers and programmers and tech people that I know. And I love history because I've watched you guys for a long time, as long as I've been alive, because I've always loved your tennis players, your cricketers, even your squash players. So I was happy when Angela reached out to me, it's like, wow, you guys, it's great to connect. And when she said, hey, you're doing some cool stuff in AI and real estate, it's like, why not?
Speaker B: Good.
Speaker A: So I just, I said to Angela, I got half an hour because I got a bunch of other calls, but I had to introduce myself. And then when, you know, Anaker connected to, I said, wow, this is just too cool. And I had to meet you guys and say, hey, I'd love to hear what you're doing because I appreciate AI. Whereas 99% of real estate agents don't understand what you guys are talking about. I've been living my entire life.
Speaker B: Thanks. Good to know. So, very quick introduction about what we are doing, Jeff. So myself, Nishan, I've been into software service. Hope you can hear me clear.
Speaker A: Yes, I sure can. And I can see you too.
Speaker B: Okay, awesome. Good to know. So myself, Nishanore, been into software AI blockchain industry since last eleven years.
Speaker A: Yes. Sean, are you the CEO there?
Speaker B: I'm CTO. Right.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: So we've been based in Bangalore and Ahmedabad. So these are two locations that that's where our offices are. And majorly we focus on, like, product development at scale. And previously we were majorly focusing on music. And now we started onto real real estate and healthcare. So. And then we are trying to build couple of cool products. And when we talk about cool products, but it is all about, like, how we can automate the business operations and how we can make. Make the life of, let's say, real estate agents or agencies, like maybe easy, and then let them focus on selling more rather than kind of worrying about, okay, the processes and content and everything. So that's what kind of we are positioning ourselves.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: So we have made a small tool in this era of, let's say in the. In the era of AI, everybody wants to utilize couple of tools, make their life easy. So we are focusing specifically real estate, intelligently. Intelligently. And we want to kind of give more wings to the agents so they can sell it faster, more, and then they can earn more within less time. So that's what our major vision is. That's what we are focusing. And so what we have done is like nowadays, everybody looking at the social media, everybody is scrolling videos, videos, videos, right. They like the videos. Once they see the videos. Oh, awesome. It gives them intention. Okay, I need to buy this. Or at least they look at, or at least they show the interest by looking at the videos. So. And nowadays I have seen like all the, all the listing platform. So I'm seeing right now property.com dot au. Real estate.com dot au, all the australian major listing players, real estate listing players all do have just images only. And, but the consumers are not consuming images, they are scrolling. They're just looking at the videos. So let's, if you consider Instagram, Facebook, talk, this, all the video platforms. So that's where we are kind of trying to fill the gap rather than images. We convert everything into video.
Speaker A: And can I tell you one thing I want, and I want you to think about it. I want. When people have a hashtag, it may say Miami Beach. I want your AI to help me find anyone who's tagged a hashtag Miami beach. Send them to me. Yeah.
Speaker B: So that's, that's possible, right? I mean, there are a couple of tools already available.
Speaker A: Yes. And when people are even talking on telephones or having conversations, when you guys hear that, send them to me.
Speaker B: So, so there are a couple of tools on the telegraph as well. I mean, not telephone, but on the telegram when people talk, so you can hear them. Okay. Okay. Hey, I mean, they are typing, they introduce themselves. You can track a couple of words. Let's say I'm introducing myself as a founder. It reach out to my CMS and then fill the detail of this person and then automatically send them introduction email. Hey, I'm JF. I saw that you are working in real estate as a founder. Here is the product that I'm working on. Would you interest to come on the call? Awesome. And that, that's a lead generation tool. So those tools already available. So by looking at all the scenarios in our experience, we come up with a very nice tool. Let me show you my screen. Quick, quick. I'm sure that you have seen the video as well.
Speaker A: Yeah, I went to your YouTube channel. So Angela sent me that. So I've been there. But. And here's the one thing too, what I wanted to do, I don't want to. If I'm going to get involved with you guys, I prefer a white label. I don't want to do anything that says restate copilot. I'm not interested in that. So I'm just telling you right up front.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: My brand, limitless USA, I've got a billion people already. There's no one that's been around the Internet or in the, the US in real estate that comes close to me. So I'm not, I'm not going to walk away from that by any means. And having restate copilot, I just don't want to do that. But if you want to license it or white label, I'm happy to do that 100%.
Speaker B: Yeah, let's discuss about that thing later stage. I'm sure like we'll find a middle stage to work upon. So these are a couple of properties that we have loaded with just two to three images just to kind of come. So one of the recent, like Sydney House, I've just recently loaded over here before the score and this is the video that it has generated.
Speaker A: You see all these words that you're popping up. I would like to have those that when there's certain words that come up, I get sent certain stuff and certain sizes and certain price tags. There's a lot of stuff that I'm thinking differently that these real estate agents don't even understand.
Speaker B: Makes sense. Yeah. So I mean these videos and templates are always changeable. But I mean, I'm sure like you are not able to hear the voice, but this is also do have a voice too, right? And then there is a kind of over here you can download and share on your social medias. Apart from that, we are also showing creating a presentation as well like this. So whenever, if you are going any meeting and you want to present this same, you want to pitch somebody. I mean it's easy for real estate agent as well share them the whole presentation. So rather than explaining. So video presentation and very nice social media description. You can see it's, it's here, the hashtag, what he was talking about.
Speaker A: What do you guys specialize in? Are you experts at blockchain or are you experts at AI? What is your specialty? What, what's your chance? Claim to fame?
Speaker B: I'd say on tech side too, blockchain and AI. And in terms of industry specific, we are penetrating right now, healthcare and real estate. We are very good at music and business automation. Now we are trying to hit specific industry of healthcare and real estate. That's where our focus is on how.
Speaker A: Many engineers do you have that specialize in real estate and AI?
Speaker B: So to be, to be very precise, on the AI, we do have twelve people right now, and the total size of the company is 4040. And for the real estate, I mean, we don't have any expertise, but we are exploring and doing joint venture with the agents and who are expert into specific industry.
Speaker A: Do you have an office? I'm just talking out loud on things that I like. I've watched Singapore for crypto for a long time. I love Singapore and I love Dubai. Do you have any plans to go to either of those places?
Speaker B: Yeah, for the Dubai, I just came back last week. I was there for in Tokyo 2014. Anyway. And for the Singapore, I'm going traveling on the 2 June for a week because there is an event called Super React. That's where I'm traveling.
Speaker A: Yeah. And Singaporeans are incredible in crypto as well. And that's another passion of mine. So the Singaporeans are way more advanced than the rest of the world. Way more than Americans or Europeans.
Speaker B: Yeah, 100%. And the government is super, super, like, awesome. They are spending a lot of money in upgrading their own people. Like, they allocated a 40,000 Singapore dollar for every person in the country to upgrade themselves with the AI. And I was like, wow. So we are registering our company in Singapore? Yes.
Speaker A: Okay. Well, I just wanted to say that because that's where I think I've got a billion people on my network, and I know a ton of them are in London, a ton of them are in New York, a ton are in Beverly Hills, a lot in Dubai. Singapore is very good, and Switzerland is always good. And I just, I think globally, whereas most american real estate people think the world begins in New York and ends in Los Angeles. I don't.
Speaker B: I know. And that is not the case anymore.
Speaker A: Well, it is in american real estate. It is.
Speaker B: Oh, okay. Uh huh.
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: Okay. Good enough. I mean, so that's where kind of the, like. So how exactly it works. Let me kind of give you a little bit of heads up. So as a real estate agent or.
Speaker A: A company, Australia's very small potatoes. It's not. They get some nice stuff, but I don't want to go into one bedroom and one. I want things that are like 10 million plus. I don't mess around with things that small, just so you know, in the shop.
Speaker B: Makes sense.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: I mean, we also want to think bigger, and I can see the synergy, but let's kind of work it out. So I'm just giving you a little bit heads up like this. How like very simple, five minutes even maybe less than five minutes. You just need to kind of add all the details and then you click on the generate and then you are good to go. So once you generate and then you do have all the videos, presentation, social description, then you do have all the media for your, for your, let's say.
Speaker A: And as far as a limitless brand, I mean that's your brand. What happens if I have a developer that has his own unique style and wants his own logos? Can, can you adopt that?
Speaker B: Yes, yes, yes. So right now we have created couple of templates.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: So you just need to tell us like what kind of, so let me kind of quickly go to, so for the presentation we have made it. So you can see like these are different presentations, styles. You can see now you see the presentation has been changed with the color and theme and whatever the developers want. So that is definitely so that comes under as a custom development. But yeah that's 100% doable.
Speaker A: And as far as copy, do you have any specs like you have x number of words you need or want or do I provide, would I provide you with the copy to drop in or what? What do you do with copy and photos? So yes I do.
Speaker B: So yeah so as a show you quick if you go to generate over here. So let's say I write Sydney house apartment, then you select and then that says is this the random number I'm just putting right now for you?
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: Let's say it's of 5000 sqft acres, square feet. Whether it's sell or rent, ready to move, recently renovated, under construction, whether it's furnished, semi furnished, unfurnished and you can say apartment is a peaceful living.
Speaker A: Okay so as far as AI, that would still be me as a real estate person filling this up.
Speaker B: Yeah you seem to fill a little bit all the details.
Speaker A: Me or my team fill stuff out with suggestions or not? No.
Speaker B: So basically you don't have to kind of come up with any suggestions or like that. You just need to upload all the images and everything because I haven't kind of. So now I go to like create videos. You need to create video, click over here and then this upload like select your voice for the video, which voice you want to go with or maybe if you want to kind of go with your custom voice that is available. You keep a background music that's a custom music. Then you upload your all the COVID images like that. Let me kind of show you.
Speaker A: Let'S.
Speaker B: Say this is my cover image and you upload, let's say that's a kitchen. Then I upload a kitchen over here like this. And then you give me, let's say you address square feet by square feet. And then you upload like all the details like this should not take more than five minutes. And then you are good to go, you click on generate and it will kind of come back over here and then it will generate videos, presentations, everything for you. So normally what happens based on our analysis is like if you want to create one video, normally you need to keep video editor again, then ask them, okay, edit this, edit this, edit this. And then it gives you a lot of back and forth and might take kind of a couple of days over here. Within five minutes, your initial level of video is ready. So you can start marketing that faster. And again, whoever don't have this tool, the time is everything in the real set. If you pitch somebody faster, you show you get their interest and then you keep selling them videos. Okay. Hey, here is the photos, videos, presentation. So it gives them a feeling and intention. Okay. Yeah, man, this looks awesome. I need to buy this.
Speaker A: Do you have you with your AI system? Like if you put that, that Sydney video, do you have AI that tells you what the neighborhood is like in that postcode 2060, it drops in more information and helps copywriters write more. Do you have. Because with Genesis and chat gdp, they do a lot of this stuff. So I'm guessing what are you doing any different or better?
Speaker B: Yeah, so basically whenever you saw right now we have kind of because of like you can see no Google address found over here. So we have kept that, but we have kind of like restrict that feature. So based on this Google location in the presentation, you will find nearby hospitals, nearby food restaurants, everything. And then it will add you everything in the, in the presentation. So, so that is already there. So at least before you purchase, it shows you. Okay. Nearby restaurant, how many nearby airport. Yes. Metro. Yes. And then what is nearby location for worth seeing like that. So, and that give you a little bit heads up. Okay. Yeah, I mean, there's those many information. If I need to pull it, take a lot of time. So it's better that AI works by themselves. So it's a real estate agentic workflow. I would say like beside agent or real estate agent, it works with them and make it faster. It is not replacing, but it is helping them to sell faster.
Speaker A: Right.
Speaker B: Do you like the tool?
Speaker A: How do you view Zillow. What do you think is Zillow as a competitor to you?
Speaker B: Zillow is something like it is pulling all the data for you and then it is showing listings and getting all the data of that particular area or nearby areas. Over here we are helping to create a content on top of that, so at least you can sell faster. Zillow is for informational point of view. Here it's a content point of view. So both are very, very different.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: So maybe Zillow also can come and integrate this as a rest API and say, okay, I will provide this, all the details, give me presentation, video description, everything, and then it gives to them on their listing platform.
Speaker A: And do you do any augmented or virtual reality plans with this site?
Speaker B: So right now, to be honest, no. We are just trying to test the market where we are seeing, okay, whether we are getting initial direction. Couple of agents and couple of agency already asked her for whiteable solution and we are here in the negotiation with them for the IP related items. Like, because you want to make sure like IP sits with us and it is not a resellable solution that you can, yes, you can use it unlimited time on your hosting, but with your brand. But we don't want to kind of sell IP, so you cannot resell. So that's what a little bit of negotiation going on. But yeah, I mean, this tool, we have seen a good traction right now.
Speaker A: Okay, well, hey, Nishan, I really appreciate you showing me this and taking me through this. And Angela, thank you very much for this. It's great to know of you guys and be aware of you guys. But as I said, I've only got half an hour. I got a bunch of other calls I got to jump onto because I'm not in the US and working on weird time zone here.
Speaker B: No worries. So what is your take on this and what could be the next section item? Do you see like value in this or do you want to see another demo?
Speaker A: Well, I think I know exactly what you guys do. It's just like not quite advanced enough where I need to go right now. You're still a little bit early for me, but. And I'm actually more into selling things that are being built and looking for a little bit different pool than this. But it's certainly nice to meet you guys and see what you're doing.
Speaker B: Okay, so what I understood is like, this is not something your area of interest for the reselling.
Speaker A: Yeah, no, I'm just, I always look at what's cutting edge and what's innovative and what's breakthrough and what's disruptive. I want to be like Elon Musk is to cars or Steve Jobs was to mobile phones. I want to be that guy in real estate.
Speaker B: Makes sense. Yeah. I mean, we can make it very cool, nice with your branding just to make sure, like, it looks like, okay, this is your brand and looks awesome, interactive, more of 3d kind of things. So it feels nicer. But again, it's subject to discussion down the line. If you are interested in.
Speaker A: Oh, I'm interested, and it's great to meet you guys, but I don't see anything that, and I'm not being negative or anything, it's not quite as progressed as where I would like to go and where I'm thinking about and who keeps me up. I look at what Airbnb is doing, I look at Zillow, I look at companies like that, and those are the companies that I love, what they're doing and where they're going. And even with on the AI front, it's just incredible to see how fast everything is progressing on that front. And I actually see AI now producing movies and videos and stuff, and you guys aren't quite there yet, but you gotta keep up with what's happening in the AI. And I know you guys are just starting, but I would have loved to have seen where you could actually, if I gave you the size that you could create videos for me. Even things that are being built, not just still images, because that's flat and that's boring. I don't want to be there.
Speaker B: Make sure I understood completely what you are saying. I like your feedback. Like, you want more of, like, attractive rather than 2d images. I completely agree with that. And thanks for that feedback, too.
Speaker A: Well, hey, it's. It's been a pleasure, and I always meet. Love meeting you guys. And, Angela, thank you for setting this up. And I'm sorry to be, you know, so upfront, but, you know, I mean, we like that.
Speaker B: It's not something like we don't like it. We like honest feedback. So thanks for that.
Speaker A: Well, hey, I'm originally from New York, so I call it like I see it, you know, 100%.
Speaker B: Yeah, we like your feedback as well. And thanks for Beth.
Speaker A: Well, you guys have a wonderful day. I gotta keep running, but if anything updates or changes, Angela, you know where to find me. Now we're connected. And, you know, I gotta say, nishant, nice to meet you. Ankur, great to connect with you, too. And in fact, I would love to stay in contact because I want to come over to your part of the world soon, too.
Speaker B: Look forward to that. Thank you.
Speaker A: Bye, guys.
Speaker B: Bye. Thanks for your time. Bye bye.
